# Who Among Us
### A real-time silly social game using Socket.IO

## How well do you know your friends?

Play a round to determine which of you knows each other the best. Start by submitting a prompt that could apply to anyone, everyone, or no one in the group (e.g. Who among us has seen The Godfather?). Each player (including the asker) will have the chance to respond in private, then guess how many people in the group the prompt applies to (in this case, how many people have seen The Godfather). You get points for being in the ballpark, more points if you guess the number exactly. Point values are increased in the second and final round, and you'll even lose points for a particularly bad guess. The player with the most points at the end of both rounds wins!

## How do I play?

Head to https://whoamongus.xyz to start. It's best to have someone host and share their screen via google hangouts, discord or whatever; and have everyone submit and answer prompts on their phones.

## How did you make this?

Javascript. React for the front-end, Node and Express for the back-end. Socket.IO for the real-time communication between the two.

## Sick. Where can I learn more about you?

## Are you gonna make more games?

Oh yea.
